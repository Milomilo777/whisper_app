"""Cross-platform process-tree termination.

``Popen.terminate()`` / ``Popen.kill()`` only signal the immediate child.
On Windows ``TerminateProcess`` does NOT cascade to descendants, so a
worker's ffmpeg / ffprobe / demucs grandchildren (or yt-dlp's ffmpeg merge
child) are orphaned when the parent is killed — they keep running, hold the
source/output file handle open, burn CPU/RAM, and on CUDA can leave a stale
GPU allocation. These helpers kill the WHOLE tree:

  * Windows — ``taskkill /T`` (optionally ``/F``) walks the PID tree.
  * POSIX   — ``os.killpg`` the process group (the caller must spawn the
              process with ``start_new_session=True`` so it leads its own
              group); falls back to signalling just the parent.

Every function is best-effort and never raises.
