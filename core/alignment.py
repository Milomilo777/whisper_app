"""Word-level alignment refinement via stable-ts (opt-in).

``stable_whisper`` (PyPI: ``stable-ts``) does dynamic-time-warping
on the cross-attention weights to lock down word start/end times to
± 50 ms accuracy, much better than Whisper's native word timestamps
which can wobble by 100–300 ms on short words.

We invoke it as a post-processor: after our segments are written we
build a ``stable_whisper.WhisperResult`` from them, call
``model.align(audio, result)``, and splice the refined word lists
back into the caller's segments. The model is a Whisper checkpoint
loaded via ``stable_whisper.load_model("tiny")`` — small enough
(~75 MB) to keep the alignment overhead minimal.

Previous versions of this module passed the segment dict list
directly to ``stable_whisper.align()`` which expected text + audio
+ ``original_split=True``; that signature mismatch silently aborted
every alignment run (the caller swallowed the resulting TypeError
in a broad ``except Exception``). The current implementation calls
the model's own ``.align()`` method which accepts a WhisperResult
shaped exactly like what the caller already has.
