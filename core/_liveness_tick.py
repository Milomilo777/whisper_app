"""Periodic-log helper to keep silent C calls visible to the
worker-liveness watchdog.

The parent's :data:`TranscriptionService.LIVENESS_TIMEOUT_S`
watchdog assumes "no events from worker for X seconds" implies a
wedged worker and SIGTERMs it. Single long-running C-level calls
(sherpa-onnx, ctranslate2, demucs subprocess, llama-cpp, stable-ts
align) routinely run longer than that window with the GIL held and
emit nothing to stdout while they run, so the parent kills the
worker mid-pass on slow hardware. The just-fixed diarisation case
is the prototype; the same shape recurs in P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, and
P0-4 of ``docs/STABILITY_AUDIT_2026-05-23.md``.

This module provides one tiny context manager,
:func:`liveness_tick`, that spawns a daemon thread emitting one
log line every ``interval_seconds`` for the duration of the
``with`` body. The log line travels through the worker's existing
event channel (any event on the worker's stdout resets
``last_event_at`` on the parent side), so wrapping a silent C call
in ``with liveness_tick(log_cb, "label"): ...`` is sufficient to
keep the watchdog quiet.

Behaviour notes:

  * If ``log_cb`` is ``None`` the helper is a no-op; the body runs
    unwrapped with zero overhead.
  * The first tick fires after one full interval, not immediately,
    because the caller normally emits its own kickoff log line just
    before the ``with`` block.
  * The ticker thread is a daemon and is not joined on exit — on
    process shutdown we never want the parent caller to block
    waiting for the next interval tick.
  * Exceptions raised inside ``log_cb`` (e.g. broken pipe to a
    dead worker) silently stop the ticker; they are deliberately
    not propagated because the body's own outcome is what callers
    care about.
