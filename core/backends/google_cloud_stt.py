"""Optional REAL Google **Cloud** Speech-to-Text v2 backend.

This is distinct from ``core/backends/cloud_stt.py`` (the Gemini-API
"paste a free key" backend). This backend targets the production
``speech.googleapis.com`` v2 service, which:

  * Authenticates with a **service-account JSON file** (NOT a pasted API
    key). The user downloads it from the Google Cloud console
    (IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Keys) and points the app at it.
  * Returns real word-level timestamps and (optionally) speaker
    diarization labels.

Like the Gemini backend it **uploads audio to Google** and therefore
breaks the project's offline guarantee — the UI makes that loud.

Two modes (config ``gcloud_stt_batch_mode``)
--------------------------------------------
* **STANDARD (online, default)** — ``client.recognize`` accepts inline
  audio only up to ~1 minute / ~10 MB per request, so we decode the file
  to 16 kHz mono FLAC with the bundled ffmpeg, split it into <=~55 s
  chunks, call ``recognize`` per chunk inline, offset each chunk's
  timestamps by the chunk start, and stitch. No Google Cloud Storage
  needed. (~$0.016/min)
* **BATCH (cheaper, slower)** — v2 ``batch_recognize`` only accepts a
  ``gs://`` URI, so this mode REQUIRES a user-configured GCS bucket
  (``gcloud_stt_bucket``). We upload the decoded audio, run a
  long-running batch op with ``ProcessingStrategy.DYNAMIC_BATCHING``
  (~75% cheaper, up to ~24 h turnaround), read the inline result, and
  delete the uploaded blob. Needs ``google-cloud-storage`` (on-demand).
  If no bucket is configured, batch is refused with a clear message.

Verified request shapes (Google Cloud STT v2 docs, fetched 2026-06-06)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Synchronous recognize (``SpeechClient.recognize``), the special
  ``recognizers/_`` inline recognizer path, ``RecognitionConfig`` with
  ``auto_decoding_config`` / ``explicit_decoding_config``,
  ``language_codes``, ``model``, ``features`` (word time offsets +
  ``SpeakerDiarizationConfig``):
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/transcribe-client-libraries
* Batch recognize (``BatchRecognizeRequest`` with
  ``BatchRecognizeFileMetadata(uri="gs://...")``,
  ``RecognitionOutputConfig(inline_response_config=InlineOutputConfig())``,
  the long-running operation, and reading
  ``response.results[uri].transcript.results``):
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/batch-recognize
* ``WordInfo`` fields (``word``, ``start_offset`` / ``end_offset`` are
  ``google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration``, exposed as
  ``datetime.timedelta`` at the proto-plus attribute level;
  ``confidence``, ``speaker_label``):
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/speech/latest/google.cloud.speech_v2.types.WordInfo
* Available models (``long`` is the long-form default; ``short``,
  ``chirp``, ``chirp_2``, ``telephony``…):
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages

The heavy ``google-cloud-speech`` / ``google-cloud-storage`` libraries
are installed **on demand** via ``core.optional_deps`` (feature key
``google_cloud_stt``); they are NEVER bundled into the slim embed tree
(mirrors how ``alignment`` / ``whisper_backend`` pull torch on demand).
Audio is decoded + chunked to FLAC with the bundled ffmpeg.

#: Default v2 model. A CONFIG value (``gcloud_stt_model``) overrides it so
#: a renamed / newer model needs no code change. ``chirp_2`` is chosen as
#: the default because the app's default Transcribe language is "Auto" and
#: ``chirp_2`` supports BOTH auto language detection (``["auto"]``) AND an
#: explicit BCP-47 code. The older ``long`` model does NOT accept ``auto``
#: (live-tested: ``400 ... "auto" is not supported by "long"``), so it would
#: break the default Auto job. ``chirp_2`` also returns excellent per-word
#: time offsets, which we always request for usable SRT/VTT timing.
DEFAULT_MODEL = "chirp_2"
#: Default location/region. ``chirp_2`` is a REGIONAL model — it does NOT
#: exist in ``global`` (live-tested: a ``global`` recognize for ``chirp_2``
#: 400s), so the default location must be a region. ``us-central1`` carries
#: ``chirp_2``. A config value (``gcloud_stt_location``) overrides this; the
#: client automatically targets the matching regional endpoint for any
#: non-``global`` location.
DEFAULT_LOCATION = "us-central1"
#: STANDARD (online) recognize caps inline audio at ~1 min / ~10 MB. Keep
#: chunks comfortably under the 1-minute wall so a chunk never gets
#: rejected for length. A config value (``gcloud_stt_chunk_seconds``)
