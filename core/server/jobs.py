"""Bounded, single-worker transcription job manager for the LAN server.

This module is intentionally Tk-free and imports nothing from ``app/``.
It owns a small in-memory job table and a SINGLE background worker thread
that processes queued jobs one at a time. Sequential processing is a
deliberate design choice, not a limitation:

  * ``core.transcriber`` keeps the ~3 GB Whisper model in a module-global
    (``MODEL`` / ``PIPELINE``). Loading it once and reusing it keeps the
    model HOT across jobs.
  * Running ``transcribe()`` concurrently against that shared global is
    unsafe; one worker thread naturally bounds concurrency to 1.

Each job's media is written into a per-job temp dir under
``user_cache_dir()/server_jobs/<uuid>/``. ``core.transcriber.transcribe``
writes its outputs NEXT TO the input file (the beside-input contract), so
the outputs land in that same per-job dir with no path-traversal risk.

A job is one of:

  * an UPLOAD — raw media bytes the handler streamed into the per-job dir,
  * a URL — an http(s) link downloaded with yt-dlp into the per-job dir
    first, then transcribed.

The transcribe driver is injected (``transcribe_fn``) so tests can run the
whole state machine against a fake that just writes dummy output files —
never the real model.
