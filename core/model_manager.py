# ---------------------------------------------------------------- model picker
#
# v0.8 — pick one of several pre-bundled faster-whisper variants from
# the Advanced dialog. Each entry resolves to the ``model`` sub-dict
# (name + url + md5) the rest of this module already consumes.
#
# Mirror URLs follow the existing smch.ir convention so adding a new
# entry is a one-line change. ``approx_size_gb`` is shown in the
# Advanced dropdown so the user knows the install cost up front.

# This is the BUILT-IN default catalog. It is the lowest-priority source —
# the online config (see core.config) may ADD or OVERRIDE entries under its
# ``model_catalog`` key, so new models can ship without an app update. Use
# ``catalog_models(config)`` / ``catalog_resolve_entry(config, slug)`` to read
# the merged effective catalog; the bare ``MODEL_REGISTRY`` / ``list_models``
# / ``resolve_model_entry`` helpers keep returning the built-ins only (still
# used as the offline fallback and by existing tests).
#
# Every entry carries an explicit ``"hf_repo"`` — the exact HuggingFace
# ``Org/Repo`` id this model downloads from when the smch.ir mirror is
# unavailable (or, for entries with no mirror at all, ALWAYS). This makes
# the HuggingFace fallback deterministic: ``_hf_model_ref`` prefers
# ``hf_repo`` over the name-based guesses (``_short_model_id`` /
# ``_repo_id_from_url``), which can resolve to the wrong upstream org for
# models that share a faster-whisper "short id" with a different repo
# (e.g. ``deepdml-large-v3-turbo`` vs. the mobiuslabsgmbh turbo, both of
# which faster-whisper's own map would resolve to the SAME
# ``large-v3-turbo`` short id).
#
# Only the four original entries (large-v3, large-v3-turbo,
# distil-large-v3.5, medium) have a real smch.ir mirror ``url``/``md5``.
# Every other entry has ``url=""``/``md5=""``: ``ensure_model`` skips the
# mirror attempt entirely for those and downloads straight from
# ``hf_repo`` via ``_download_via_huggingface``.
