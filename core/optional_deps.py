"""On-demand optional dependencies.

Heavy optional features — stable-ts word-alignment refinement and the
openai-whisper backend — pull in PyTorch (~700 MB), so they are NOT
bundled in the slim distribution. They are pip-installed on first use
into a user-writable directory that is added to ``sys.path``, mirroring
the on-demand Whisper-model download. This keeps the base install small
(~800 MB instead of ~1.5 GB) while every feature stays available.

The extras dir lives under the user's cache (writable without admin), so
this works for both the Program-Files install and the Portable build.
