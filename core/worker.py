"""Long-lived transcription worker.

Reads JSON commands from stdin, emits JSON events on stdout. The
protocol is intentionally frozen — adding fields is safe, renaming
or removing them breaks the parent UI.

Events emitted:
  - ``ready``  ([device, compute_type, requested_device, downgraded])
                                       : model loaded; accepting commands.
    The device fields are additive (R3) — they report which device the model
    actually loaded onto and whether a requested CUDA load self-healed onto
    CPU. Older parents that don't read them keep working unchanged.
  - ``startup_error``                  : model failed to load; exiting
  - ``log``       (message)             : free-text log line
  - ``progress``  (percent)             : current task progress 0–100
  - ``language_detected`` (language, probability, file_path)
  - ``started``   (file_path)           : task accepted
  - ``done``      (file_path)           : task finished writing outputs
  - ``error``     (message[, file_path]): task or worker error

Commands accepted on stdin (one JSON object per line):
  - ``{"action": "shutdown"}``
  - ``{"action": "transcribe", "file_path": "...", "language": "..."}``
  - ``{"action": "cancel"}``   : cancel the in-flight task (flush checkpoint)
  - ``{"action": "pause"}``    : pause the in-flight task at the next segment
  - ``{"action": "resume"}``   : resume a paused task

cancel/pause/resume are *control* commands: a dedicated reader thread
applies them to the running task immediately, because the main thread is
blocked inside ``transcribe()`` and cannot read stdin itself. The
transcriber polls ``task.cancelled`` / ``task.paused`` between segments.

    exceeds the cap, accumulation stops immediately; the rest of that record

    *line* keeps the trailing newline when present (matching file-iteration
    semantics) so existing ``.strip()`` handling is unchanged.

    TextIOWrapper has one). Streams that expose only iteration (some test
