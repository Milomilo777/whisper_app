"""Heuristic hallucination detection for Whisper output.

Three independent signals; any one is enough to flag a segment:

  * Bag-of-Hallucinations (BoH) — a curated list of phrases Whisper
    emits during silence or low-SNR audio (e.g. ``"Thanks for watching"``
    YouTube boilerplate that leaked in from the training set, ``"[Music]"``
    annotations, lone ``"."`` / ``"..."`` punctuation). Reference:
    arXiv 2501.11378.
  * Repetition — a token or short n-gram that repeats N+ times in a
    row inside a single segment (``"the the the the"``,
    ``"Thanks Thanks Thanks!"``). The classic Whisper long-silence
    loop pattern.
  * VAD disagreement — a segment whose ``[start, end]`` doesn't overlap
    any speech interval returned by the VAD pass. Caller-supplied;
    skipped when ``vad_segments`` is None.

When :func:`annotate_segments` flags a segment, it sets
``seg["suspect"] = True`` and ``seg["suspect_reason"] = "<which>"``
so writers + the viewer can surface the warning without re-running
detection.
