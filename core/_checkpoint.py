"""Periodic checkpoint for in-progress transcriptions.

The transcribe loop writes a JSON checkpoint to disk every N segments
or every X seconds (whichever fires first). On a cancel/pause/crash
that checkpoint is the only thing standing between the user and a
re-run from scratch.

Layout:
  ``user_data_dir() / "partials" / "<sha1(abs_source_path)>.json"``

Atomic writes go through ``<path>.tmp`` + ``os.replace`` so a torn
file is never observable to the resume path.

This module is intentionally tiny and self-contained: it imports
nothing from ``core.transcriber`` to keep the dependency direction
one-way (transcriber -> _checkpoint), and it uses no third-party
modules so tests can exercise it without faster_whisper installed.
