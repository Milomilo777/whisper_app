"""Bilingual SubRip writer — original + translated line per cue.

NOT registered in ``core.writers.WRITERS``. Every other writer follows
the frozen ``write(segments, audio_path) -> str`` contract; this one
needs a second, per-segment ``translations`` list, which doesn't fit
that shape (the same reason ``smtv_docx`` gets a special case in
``core.transcriber._write_outputs`` instead of joining the plain
registry). Unlike smtv_docx this isn't a pipeline output-format
checkbox at all — it only ever runs on demand, after a translation
pass, from the transcript viewer's AI panel
(``app/dialogs/transcript_viewer.py``), which is the only caller.
