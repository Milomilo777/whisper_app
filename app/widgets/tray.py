"""System-tray controller backed by pystray + Pillow.

When ``config["minimise_to_tray"]`` is enabled, WM_DELETE_WINDOW
hides the main window instead of exiting; the tray icon's right-
click menu offers Show / Hide / Exit. The icon colour changes
to indicate idle vs. active work so the user can glance at the
notification area and see whether a long job is still running.

pystray + Pillow are listed in requirements.txt; if either fails
to import (e.g. headless CI machine without Pillow's pre-built
binary), the module silently degrades to a no-op controller so
the rest of the App keeps booting.
