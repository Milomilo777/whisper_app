"""Whisper Project — Tk desktop app.

Layout:
    app.app                 — the App class (Tk root, wires services)
    app.dialogs             — Toplevel dialogs (model download, etc.)
    app.domain              — task models and enumerations
    app.services            — background work (downloads, transcription, formats)
    app.widgets             — small custom widgets

Public entry point: ``app.run()``.
