"""Real end-to-end test of the SMTV download pipeline.

Exercises ``DownloadService._run_smtv_task`` against a live SMTV
episode. Downloads the actual MP4 from the CDN, verifies the bytes
look like a real MP4 (contains the ftyp box), confirms the
article-text transcript landed alongside as ``<base>.txt``, and
checks that the ``done_full`` event is the one that surfaces the
saved path to the auto-transcribe-after-download wiring.

The previous unit suite covered the page parser with HTML fixtures.
The previous live smoke covered the parser + a CDN HEAD. Neither
exercised the actual streaming write, the .part → final rename,
the transcript persistence, or the event sequence — which is what
real users depend on.

Skipped offline (``WHISPER_OFFLINE_TESTS=1``) and when the host is
unreachable. Pulls ~25 MB of MP4, runs ~10 s on a decent line.
