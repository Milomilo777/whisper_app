"""Regression for core.writers.vtt._karaoke_payload non-string word text.

A converted / hand-edited JSON re-fed for re-export can carry a word whose
``word`` (text) field is a non-string truthy value (e.g. the number ``42``).
The karaoke payload used to call ``(w.get("word") or "").strip()`` bare, so
that single bad word kept the non-string value and ``.strip()`` raised
``AttributeError`` ('int' object has no attribute 'strip') — aborting the
WHOLE VTT write and losing the rest of the transcript. The round-2 fix
guarded only the numeric start coercion, not the word text. Peer writers
coerce defensively (speaker_prefix uses str()); the VTT writer must too: a
malformed word never aborts the conversion.
