"""About-dialog content builders are pure data — no Tk needed.

``App._show_about`` only walks the structures returned by
``build_about_sections`` / ``build_about_links`` into widgets, so the
content itself can be pinned without ever constructing a tk.Tk() root.
These tests guard that the About surface keeps advertising this
session's headline capabilities (cloud backends, Web/LAN, per-task
controls, video-wall auto-reconnect, in-place update) and that every
helpful link is a real, well-formed URL pointing at the right place.
