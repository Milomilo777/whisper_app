"""Per-folder ``.whisperproject.json`` overrides must not leak.

Audit P0-6: ``_apply_runtime_overrides`` mutates the module-level
``core.transcriber.config`` dict in place. The worker subprocess is
long-lived and transcribes many files in sequence, so without a
snapshot/restore wrapper a project override applied to file A in
folder /A silently persisted into file B in folder /B.

The fix is ``_runtime_overrides_scope`` — a context manager that
snapshots the keys an override is about to write and restores them
on exit. These tests pin that contract.
