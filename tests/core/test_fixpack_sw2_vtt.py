"""Regression for core.writers.vtt._karaoke_payload non-numeric word start.

A converted / hand-edited JSON re-fed for re-export can carry a word whose
``start`` is a non-numeric string (e.g. ``"abc"``). The karaoke payload used
to call ``float(w.get("start"))`` bare, so that single bad word raised
``ValueError`` and aborted the WHOLE VTT write — the rest of the transcript
was lost. Peer writers coerce timestamps defensively; the VTT writer must
do the same: a malformed word never aborts the conversion.
