"""Tests for transcription_service.transcribe_command.

This is the JSON the parent dispatches to the worker subprocess. The
worker has its OWN task object, so any field dropped here silently never
reaches transcription — the exact class of bug that shipped before
(forced language ignored, clip transcribing the whole file). These tests
lock the command contract.
