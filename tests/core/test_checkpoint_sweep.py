"""Tests for core._checkpoint.sweep_partials (audit findings [5] / P2-8).

The partials/ dir otherwise grows without bound: a cancelled-but-never-
resumed or crash-then-declined run leaves its checkpoint JSON (which holds
the full captured-segments list) forever, and a worker killed mid-resume
orphans its .slice.wav. The startup sweep reaps both by age.
