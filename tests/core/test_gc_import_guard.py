"""Tests for the shared core._gc_import_guard.

Regression coverage for a real bug found in a second-pass code review of
the 2026-08-15 GC-hardening commit: the first version of this mitigation
gave every guarded call site its OWN threading.Lock(), which does not
actually serialize gc.disable()/gc.enable() (a PROCESS-GLOBAL pair)
across modules. Two differently-locked probes running concurrently could
still race and re-enable GC mid-import on the other thread -- exactly
the crash class this mitigation exists to prevent. See
docs/history/CODE_REVIEW_v1.7.0_2026-08-15.md.
