"""Regression test for the multi-monitor _start() consumer-thread leak.

Hermetic: no real ffplay / yt-dlp / network / Tk. The multi-monitor branch of
``TilingController._start`` is driven with a stubbed ``subprocess.Popen`` whose
SECOND player (a later monitor) fails to launch. The bug: that ``except``
handler re-raised WITHOUT signalling the fan-out ``stop_event`` or waking the
consumer-writer thread already started for the FIRST monitor — so that daemon
thread (blocked on an empty queue) leaked, unbounded across reconnect attempts.

The fix mirrors the not-published / _terminate teardown: set the stop_event and
enqueue a None sentinel per started consumer (then best-effort join) before the
re-raise, so no consumer thread is left running.
