"""Hermetic regression test for the cloud-STT blob-cleanup fix.

DEFECT (LOW): on the Files-API path, ``_upload_file`` finalizes the
uploaded blob on Google's servers and then, when the file is not yet
ACTIVE, calls ``_wait_for_active`` BEFORE returning ``(file_uri,
file_name)``. If ``_wait_for_active`` raises (poll timeout, state
FAILED, or an HTTP / URL error), ``_upload_file`` never returns the
tuple, so the caller's ``finally: self._delete_file(file_name)`` never
runs (``file_name`` was never bound there) and the just-uploaded audio
blob is left on Google until its ~48 h auto-expiry — violating the
backend's "delete the uploaded blob on success OR failure" contract.

FIX: ``_upload_file`` now wraps the post-finalize wait-for-active so that
if it raises, ``self._delete_file(str(file_name))`` is attempted
best-effort before the exception is re-raised.

This test drives ``_upload_file`` directly with ``_wait_for_active`` and
``_delete_file`` stubbed, asserts the exception still propagates, and
asserts the blob was deleted with the uploaded file name. It FAILS on the
pre-fix code (no delete happens). NO network, NO API key beyond a fake
config value, NO model, NO Tk.
