"""Fixpack regression tests for core.worker — CONCURRENCY cluster.

Covers two defects:

1. emit() wrote JSON lines to stdout from the main, stdin-reader and
   heartbeat threads with NO lock, so concurrent write+flush pairs could
   interleave and corrupt a line — breaking the FROZEN one-JSON-object-
   per-line worker protocol. Fixed with a module-level _emit_lock.

2. The stdin reader buffered a whole line (``for raw in sys.stdin``)
   BEFORE the 1 MB length check, so a runaway/malicious parent could OOM
   the worker with one enormous newline-less line. Fixed with
   read_capped_lines(), which enforces the cap WHILE reading in chunks.

All tests are hermetic: no subprocess, no network, no real model, no Tk.
