"""Fixtures shared by every test subdirectory (``tests/core``, ``tests/app``,
``tests/smoke``, ...).

Autouse isolation guard: several tests call the REAL transcriber load
functions (``load_existing_model``, ``_load_whisper_model_self_healing``,
``_load_alt_backend``), which mutate ``core.transcriber`` module globals via
``global`` statements. ``monkeypatch`` cannot undo those (it only reverts
attributes it set itself), so without this guard a test that activates a fake
model or an alternate backend leaks that state into later test files — which
produces order-dependent failures whose set shifts with machine state (for
example whether a bundled Google Cloud key flips the default engine to cloud
STT). See ``docs/history/TEST_ISOLATION_FOLLOWUP.md``.

This snapshots + restores (NOT resets) the globals around every test, so a
module-scoped model fixture (e.g. ``tests/smoke/test_v08_real_file_e2e.py``'s
``transcribed_clip``) is preserved within its own module while cross-file
leakage is contained at the source. Lives at the ``tests/`` root (not just
``tests/core/``) so it also covers ``tests/smoke/``, which needed it after
``test_v08_real_file_e2e.py`` moved there 2026-08-15 (see
``docs/DECISIONS.md`` ADR 0008 / ``docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_NEXT.md`` — that move
was to stop it running concurrently with the rest of the ~700-test hermetic
suite, which was implicated in a real, hard-to-pin-down native crash).
