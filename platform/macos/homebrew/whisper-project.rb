# Homebrew formula for Whisper Project (macOS, and Linuxbrew).
#
# This is a PERSONAL-TAP formula (not homebrew-core): it builds a venv and
# pip-installs the deps at install time rather than vendoring every Python
# dependency as a pinned `resource` block. That keeps it maintainable for a
# small project; homebrew-core would require the full vendored-resource
# treatment.
#
# Requires the repo (or a release source tarball) to be PUBLIC — a Homebrew
# tap can't reach a private repo. Publish it to a tap, e.g.
#   github.com/translation-robot/homebrew-tap  →  Formula/whisper-project.rb
# then users run:
#   brew install translation-robot/tap/whisper-project
#
# At each release, update `url` to the new tag and refresh `sha256`:
#   curl -fsSL <url> | shasum -a 256
