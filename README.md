A desktop app that runs OpenAI's Whisper model **locally** — via
[faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) — so transcription
costs nothing per minute, works on a plane, and never uploads your recording to
anyone. Drop a file in and it writes `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.docx`,
`.pdf`, `.ass` and more, right next to the original. It also downloads from any site
`yt-dlp` supports, labels speakers, batches a queue of jobs, and can turn itself
into a transcription page for the other devices on your network.

No account. No API key. No subscription. Your files stay on your disk.

- 🔒 **Runs on your machine** — [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (CTranslate2) by default, plus **whisper.cpp** and **NVIDIA Parakeet**
- 📝 **14 output formats** — `srt` `vtt` `ass` `tsv` `txt` `json` `lrc` `md` `docx` `pdf`, plus oTranscribe / ELAN / InqScribe / Express Scribe
- 🎙️ **Live transcription** — a microphone or the system audio, transcribed as it happens → [docs/LIVE.md](docs/LIVE.md)
- 🗣️ **Speaker labels** — offline diarisation, per-word timestamps, time-range clipping
- 🎬 **Downloads** — any `yt-dlp` site, with optional transcribe-on-finish
- 🧹 **Adaptive denoise** — measures the audio and only cleans it when that helps → [docs/DENOISE.md](docs/DENOISE.md)
- 🌐 **Local-network mode** — turn this machine into a transcription page for your other devices
- 💸 **Free and BSD-3 licensed** — no per-minute cost, no subscription, no telemetry by default

## Download

Grab the latest build from the **[releases page](https://github.com/Milomilo777/whisper_app/releases/latest)**:

| Asset | Size | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **`WhisperProject-…-Setup-Standard.exe`** | ~215 MB | **Most people.** A normal installer: Start-menu shortcut, upgrades in place over an older version, files visible on disk. |
| **`WhisperProject-…-Portable.zip`** | ~330 MB | Unzip and run. No installation, no admin rights, happy on a USB stick. |
| **`WhisperProject-…-macOS-*.dmg`** | ~400 MB | macOS (x64 and arm64 builds are published separately). |

Everything needed is inside — a bundled Python, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` and
`yt-dlp`. The only thing fetched later is the speech model itself
(**~1–3 GB, once**, on first launch); after that the app is fully offline.

Step-by-step walkthrough, including what to click past on Windows SmartScreen:
**[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

## What it looks like

**Transcription Queue** — batch jobs with live progress; pause, resume, cancel,
re-run or remove any row.

<img src="docs/img/screenshot-queue.png" alt="Transcription Queue tab" width="100%">

**Download Videos** — any `yt-dlp` site: pick a format, clip a time range, pull
subtitles, optionally transcribe as soon as the download finishes.

**Video Tiling** — play one live stream as a full-screen N×N video wall,
optionally across several monitors.

## Features

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/img/features.png" alt="Five tabs, one window: Transcribe, Transcription Queue, Download Videos, Video Tiling, Web/LAN access, Convert transcript" width="100%">

</div>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Local transcription** | Whisper `large-v3` by default, plus `large-v3-turbo` and `distil-large-v3.5`. Backends: `faster_whisper` (default), `whisper.cpp`, NVIDIA Parakeet. |
| **Many output formats** | `srt` `vtt` `ass` `tsv` `txt` `json` `lrc` `md` `docx` `pdf` — written next to your input file. |
| **Convert transcript** | Re-emit an existing transcript into the formats above, or into oTranscribe / ELAN / InqScribe / Express Scribe. Reads `.ass` / `.ssa` too. |
| **Live transcription** | Transcribe a microphone — or whatever this machine is playing — as it happens. Chunks are cut at natural pauses so words are never split in half. |
| **Speaker diarisation** | Optional "Identify speakers", plus per-word timestamps and time-range clipping. |
| **Adaptive denoise** | Measures each recording first and only cleans it when the measurement says that helps; verifies its own output and reverts if it removed speech. |
| **Last-Result card** | File sizes, one-click **Open file** / **Open folder**, and an in-app viewer with split-pane click-to-seek playback. |
| **Batch queue** | Live status for every pending and running job, with **Pause / Resume / Cancel / Re-run / Remove** always one click away. |
| **Downloads** | Anything `yt-dlp` handles, plus Supreme Master TV episode links. Downloads resume rather than restart. |
| **Video wall** | Tile one live stream as an N×N grid across one or many monitors. |
| **Local network mode** | A stdlib-only web server so other devices can transcribe through this machine — optional password, off until you start it. |
| **Post-processing** | Automatic chapters and hallucination detection, both toggleable. |

Keyboard: `Ctrl+O` browse · `Ctrl+Enter` transcribe · `Esc` cancel ·
`Ctrl+Q` exit.

## How it works

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/img/how-it-works.png" alt="Drop a file, the Tk GUI queues it, a worker subprocess holds the model in memory and runs faster-whisper, and the transcript lands in your folder" width="100%">

</div>

The Tk GUI runs in the main process. Each transcription job runs in a
long-lived subprocess worker that keeps the Whisper model in memory and talks
back over newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout; `yt-dlp` gets its own
subprocess per download. A per-worker UUID token and a 5-second heartbeat keep
that routing robust against PID recycling and let the GUI detect a wedged
worker instead of hanging with it.

## Offline by default

Every default backend runs on your machine. Nothing is uploaded, no account
exists, and the app works with the network unplugged once the model is
downloaded.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Two **opt-in** backends break that guarantee, and both are off unless you go
> into **Advanced → Backend** and choose them. Use them only for content you
> are willing to send to a third party.
>
> - **`cloud_stt`** — Google **Gemini API**, authenticated with a free API key
>   you paste. Quickest to set up. → [docs/CLOUD_STT.md](docs/CLOUD_STT.md)
> - **`google_cloud_stt`** — full **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**, authenticated
>   with a service-account JSON file. 60 free minutes/month, speaker labels, a
>   cheaper batch mode. → [docs/CLOUD_STT_GOOGLE.md](docs/CLOUD_STT_GOOGLE.md)

The optional update check is likewise **notify-only**: it asks GitHub whether a
newer release exists, at most once a day, and never downloads or installs
anything by itself. Turn it off with `update_check_enabled`.

<details>
<summary><b>First run — choosing where the model lives</b></summary>

<br>

On first launch the app asks where to store the Whisper model files. The
default is a private per-user cache that is always writable —
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperProject\Cache\models` — never the Program Files install
directory. Pick anywhere you like instead: an external drive, a network share.

The choice is saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperProject\config.json` under
`hub_folder`, and the dialog never appears again. To start over:

```cmd
WhisperProject.exe --safe-mode
```

That moves the user config aside and re-fires the first-run dialog with the
defaults.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration keys</b></summary>

<br>

User settings live at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperProject\config.json`.

| Key | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `hub_folder` | Where Whisper model files are stored (set by the first-run dialog) |
| `model_path` | Per-model override; derived from `hub_folder + model.name` when unset |
| `whisper_model` | `large-v3` (default), `large-v3-turbo`, `distil-large-v3.5` |
| `transcribe_backend` | `faster_whisper` (default), `whisper_cpp`, `parakeet`, `cloud_stt`, `google_cloud_stt` |
| `auto_chapters_enabled`, `hallucination_detect_enabled` | Post-process toggles |
| `update_check_enabled` | Opt-in GitHub update check (on by default; notify-only) |
| `last_update_check` | ISO date of the last check (once-per-day throttle) |

Full reference: [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Updating to a newer version</b></summary>

<br>

**No uninstall needed.** The Standard installer uses a stable application ID,
so you just download the newer `…-Setup-Standard.exe` and run it — it upgrades
over the existing install and keeps your shortcut and settings. The Portable
build is self-contained: replace the old folder with the new one.

**Help → Check for updates…** runs the check on demand and also tells you when
you are already current. The quiet daily check stays silent unless something
newer exists, and fails silently when offline.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Share it on your local network</b></summary>

<br>

Rather than installing the app on every machine, let people on a trusted
network transcribe through this one. The **Web / LAN access** tab does it with
one button, an optional port, a "Share on local network" checkbox and an
optional access password.

For headless or scripted use there is an equivalent command line (same
stdlib-only HTTP engine):

```cmd
python gui.py serve          REM loopback only (no firewall prompt)
python gui.py serve --lan    REM share on the LAN (allow the firewall prompt)
```

It has no accounts and no encryption — anyone who can reach the address (and
knows the password, if you set one) can use it. Trusted networks only. Routes,
the upload cap and the `--token` option: [docs/SERVER.md](docs/SERVER.md).

</details>

## Build from source

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Milomilo777/whisper_app.git
cd whisper_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python gui.py
```

Updating a source checkout later: `platform\windows\update.bat` on Windows,
`platform/linux/update.sh` on Linux — both pull the latest source and
refresh the dependencies ([platform/windows/README.md](platform/windows/README.md)).

[docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) covers the build pipelines — which two are
actually shipped and which are kept alive but unpublished —  and
[docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) has the ship sequence.

Regenerate the images in this README with `python tools/make_graphics.py`
(they are drawn by that script, not pasted in from a design tool).

## Project status
