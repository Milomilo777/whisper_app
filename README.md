# Whisper Project — Offline Transcription + Video Downloader

A Windows-first desktop app that does two things well:

1. **Download** audio or audio + video from any site `yt-dlp` supports, with optional automatic subtitles in any of 30+ languages.
2. **Transcribe** local audio/video files into SRT subtitles using `faster-whisper`, fully offline.

Built for the workflow of producing bilingual subtitle files (English ↔ Persian and others) for TV broadcast, where every download eventually needs accurate, well-timed captions.

## What sets it apart

- **Truly offline transcription.** Once the model is downloaded (one time, ~3 GB), no network is required for transcription. No data leaves the machine.
- **Bundled binaries.** `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `yt-dlp` ship in `bin/`. No system install required.
- **Resumable, verified model download.** The model is fetched as a ZIP from a CDN mirror, then every extracted file is MD5-verified. Interrupted downloads resume; corrupt extracts are detected and retried.
- **Crash isolation.** Transcription runs in a long-lived subprocess worker; if the model crashes the UI stays up.
- **Multiple parallel workers** for transcription, each holding the model in memory.
- **Per-phase status** during downloads — you see when the subtitle phase succeeds, fails, or has no captions available, separately from the media phase.
- **oTranscribe round-trip** — export a finished transcription to `.otr` for human proofing in [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/), then import the edited `.otr` back to SRT.

## Status

Working draft. See [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md) for known issues and [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the planned trajectory.

The app is usable today for the core flows. The roadmap describes how it gets from "useful for one person" to "best-in-class for the niche."

## Quick start

### Option A — Download the pre-built exe (no Python required)

For end users who just want to run the app:

🔗 **[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Milomilo777/whisper_project_direct_download_v2/releases/latest)** — a single ~450 MB ZIP that contains the exe, all DLLs, bundled `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`/`yt-dlp`, and the Silero VAD asset. Extract anywhere, run `WhisperProject.exe`. The 3 GB Whisper model downloads automatically on first launch.

Step-by-step installation guide (Persian-friendly, end-user focused): **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

### Option B — Build from source

For developers who want to hack on the code.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / 11 (Linux and macOS are not officially supported yet, but the Python code is mostly portable)
- Python 3.11 or newer
- ~3 GB free disk for the Whisper `large-v3` model
- An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA is recommended; CPU works but is much slower

### Install

```powershell
git clone <repo-url>
cd whisper_project_direct_download_v2

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then ensure the bundled binaries are in `bin/`:

```
bin/
├── ffmpeg.exe       # ~100 MB
├── ffprobe.exe      # ~100 MB
└── yt-dlp.exe       # ~18 MB
```

These are not checked into git. Download from:

- ffmpeg / ffprobe: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/> (release essentials build)
- yt-dlp: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest>

### Run

```powershell
python gui.py
```

On the first launch, the app will check for the Whisper model. If it isn't found at `config.json:model_path`, a dialog appears, downloads the ZIP, verifies it, and extracts it. Subsequent launches are instant.

## Tabs

### Transcribe

Pick a local audio or video file. The transcribe button enqueues it for the worker subprocess. SRT and JSON are written next to the input file with the same base name.

The `Import .otr → SRT...` button below the transcribe controls reads an oTranscribe-edited `.otr` file and writes a clean SRT to a folder of your choice. End times are inferred from the next segment's start; the last segment's end is the file's `media-time` (or `start + 5s`, whichever is greater).

### Transcription Queue

Live status of all enqueued transcription jobs. Right-click a row to cancel a running job, remove a finished one, or — when the job is `finished` — `Export → oTranscribe (.otr)` to write an `.otr` file next to the source media for downstream proofing in oTranscribe.

### Download Videos

Paste a URL; the app auto-loads format options via `yt-dlp --dump-single-json`. Choose audio-only or audio+video, format, output extension. Optionally check "Download subtitles" and pick a language (Automatic detects from the video's metadata).

Files land in the folder you choose. The folder, subtitle preference, and subtitle language are remembered across sessions.

## Configuration

Settings live in `config.json` next to `gui.py`. See [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md) (coming) for the full field reference.

Key fields:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model.url` | smch.ir mirror | The ZIP source for `ensure_model` |
| `model.md5` | `<url>.md5` | The file-by-file MD5 manifest |
| `model_path` | (user-specific) | Where the extracted model goes |
| `device` | `auto` | `auto` / `cuda` / `cpu` |
| `compute_type` | `int8` | faster-whisper compute_type |
| `parallel_workers` | `2` | Max concurrent transcription workers |
| `download_folder` | (last used) | Default target for new downloads |

## Known limitations

The list below reflects the current state after Sessions 1–6. For everything fixed since the project started, see [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) (Unreleased + v0.3.0). For the full backlog see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

**Working as designed but with rough edges:**

- **Chinese transcripts come out as wall-of-text.** Whisper's Mandarin output has very little punctuation by default. Mitigation strategies (initial-prompt nudge, FunASR `ct-punc` post-processor, SenseVoice backend) are documented in [Phase 6.2](docs/ROADMAP.md). Not yet implemented — manual editing in the transcript output is the current workaround.
- **Subtitle line splitting uses the Latin-text 42-char default everywhere.** For Chinese you want ~16 zh-Hans glyphs per line, not 42 cells. Width-aware splitting is [Phase 6.3](docs/ROADMAP.md) — not yet implemented.
- **No model picker UI.** The active model is hard-coded to `faster-whisper-large-v3` via `config.json` `model_path`. To use a different model, edit `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperProject\config.json` manually and point `model_path` at the new folder. UI picker is part of Phase 2b (deferred).
- **No drag-and-drop, no folder watcher.** Add files via the Browse button; no batch-watch on a folder. Phase 2c.
- **No live microphone / dictation mode.** Offline file transcription only. Phase 5.3 (live mic) is a separate effort.
- **No CI yet.** 136 local unit tests + 8 smoke tests run with `pytest`, but no GitHub Actions workflow runs them on every push. Phase 7.3.
- **No in-app transcript editor.** Subtitles are written to disk as SRT/VTT/JSON; if you need to proofread, open them in oTranscribe (round-trip is built in: `Export → oTranscribe (.otr)` on the queue tab) or any subtitle editor. In-app editor is Phase 4.
- **`large-v3` model is ~3 GB on disk and needs ~5 GB VRAM on GPU at fp16, or ~3 GB RAM on CPU int8.** Smaller models (e.g. `tiny`, `base`, `medium`, `distil-large-v3`) would be a click away if the model picker landed.

**Already fixed since the project was first audited (so the original Known limitations are gone):**

- ✅ `yt-dlp --update` no longer runs unconditionally — gated behind `auto_update_yt_dlp` config flag and a 24h timestamp (Phase 0)
- ✅ `ffprobe` resolves to `bin/ffprobe.exe` via the `bundled_binary` helper (Phase 0)
- ✅ Sun Valley theme with Light/Dark/System picker under `View` menu (Phase 1.1)
- ✅ 136 unit tests + 77% coverage on `core/` + `pytest` infrastructure (Phase 1b)
- ✅ `tests/smoke/` integration suite — drives the compiled exe end-to-end (catches PyInstaller packaging bugs that source-side tests can't) (Session 8)
- ✅ Multi-format output (SRT/VTT/TSV/TXT/JSON/LRC), VAD on by default, word-level timestamps, language detection display, `BatchedInferencePipeline` on GPU (Phase 2a)
- ✅ SQLite history with restore-on-launch, SponsorBlock integration, auto-transcribe-after-download, `--progress-template "%(progress)j"` (Phase 3a)
- ✅ PyInstaller build pipeline with `build.bat`, smoke test, BUILD.md (Session 5 final compile)
