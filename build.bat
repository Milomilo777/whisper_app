REM build.bat - Windows production build script for whisper_project_direct_download_v2
REM Runs PyInstaller, then verifies the bundled binaries actually landed in dist/.
REM
REM Usage:
REM   build.bat              (full build)
REM   build.bat clean        (wipe build/ and dist/ first)
REM   build.bat verify       (skip PyInstaller, just verify the existing dist/)
REM   build.bat smoke        (verify and then launch the exe for 5 seconds)
REM
REM Exit codes:
REM   0  success
REM   1  PyInstaller failure
REM   2  post-build verification failure (a required file is missing)
REM   3  smoke launch failure (exe died within 5 seconds)

REM Note: config.json is intentionally NOT copied to dist\.
REM Phase 1.2 migrated config to %%LOCALAPPDATA%%\WhisperProject\config.json,
REM and load_config() now produces it on first launch from DEFAULT_CONFIG.
REM If you ever need a portable build that keeps config next to the exe,
REM add a "portable" build mode that copies config.json explicitly.
