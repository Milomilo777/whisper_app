# Build

How to produce Windows binaries from source.

**Currently shipped (both from the same `embed_build\` tree):**
Setup-Standard (installer) + Portable (zip of that same tree — NOT
a PyInstaller onefile exe; that changed at v1.3.2, see CLAUDE.md
"Style & scope"). The PyInstaller onefile (Method A below) and
Compact/onedir (Method B) pipelines still exist and still build —
their specs are kept in lock-step so they don't bit-rot — but
neither is published.

## TL;DR — the two shipped deliverables

(replace `X.Y.Z` with the current `core.__version__` / `MyAppVersion`)

```cmd
:: 1. Build the embed tree (downloads Python, installs requirements.txt, copies app/core/bin)
build_embed_installer.bat
:: Output: embed_build\

:: 2. Setup-Standard installer, from embed_build\
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer_embed.iss
:: Output: dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Standard.exe

:: 3. Portable zip — literally the same embed_build\ tree, zipped whole
python -c "import shutil; shutil.make_archive(r'dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable', 'zip', r'embed_build')"
:: Output: dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.zip
```

See "Rebuild without bumping the version" below for the full,
copy-pasteable recipe (including uploading to the existing GitHub
release) used when re-shipping the SAME version with source-only
changes.

## Unshipped / optional pipelines

```cmd
:: Method A — Portable single-file exe (~447 MB; NOT the shipped "Portable" — unpublished)
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean whisper_project_onefile.spec
:: Output: dist\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.exe

:: Method B — Compact installer (~326 MB; unshipped, optional)
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --distpath dist_onedir whisper_project_onedir.spec
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer.iss
:: Output: dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Compact.exe
```

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+ on PATH (used to invoke PyInstaller and pip).
* `pip install pyinstaller` in the working environment.
* `bin\ffmpeg.exe`, `bin\ffprobe.exe`, `bin\yt-dlp.exe` checked into
  the repo's `bin\` folder — Method A and B bundle them via the
  spec's `('bin', 'bin')` data entry; Method C copies them with
  `xcopy`.
* Inno Setup 6 for Methods B and C. Install via `winget install
  JRSoftware.InnoSetup`. It lands at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe`.
* Method C also needs `tar.exe` from `%SystemRoot%\System32\` (the
  Windows-native bsdtar, not Git's tar — Git's tar tries to treat
  the `C:\` path as a remote host).

## Method A — Portable

```cmd
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean whisper_project_onefile.spec
```

Builds a single self-extracting executable. At launch, PyInstaller
unpacks the bundle to `%TEMP%\_MEI<random>\` (~5 s on a typical
machine) and runs the app from there. `core.paths.resource_base()`
points to that temp dir at runtime.

Output: `dist\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.exe` (~447 MB; the bundled
`stable_whisper` + transitive `torch` pushed the v0.7.0 ~190 MB up by
the audit-2 polish push).

## Method B — Compact installer

Two steps. First produce the onedir tree:

```cmd
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --distpath dist_onedir whisper_project_onedir.spec
```

This drops a fully-extracted PyInstaller bundle under
`dist_onedir\WhisperProject\` with the exe and its sibling DLLs
flat at the top (the spec sets `contents_directory='.'`).

Then wrap it in an Inno Setup installer:

```cmd
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer.iss
```

The installer uses LZMA2 ultra compression, packs the ~478 MB
onedir tree to ~137 MB, ships per-user / per-machine shortcuts, and
gives users a real Add/Remove Programs entry.

Output: `dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Compact.exe`
(~137 MB).

## Method C — Standard installer with embeddable Python

```cmd
build_embed_installer.bat
```

The batch script:

1. Downloads
   `cpython-3.11.15+20260510-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only.tar.gz`
   from
   [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone).
   This is a full CPython install with `tkinter` and the Tcl/Tk
   runtime — python.org's "embeddable" zip is stripped of tkinter,
   so we cannot use it directly.
2. Extracts it with the Windows-native `tar.exe`.
3. Verifies tkinter is importable.
4. `pip install --target` reads `requirements.txt` into the
   embed-build's `Lib\site-packages\`.
5. Copies `app\`, `core\`, `bin\`, and `gui.py` into the embed tree.
6. Writes a `sitecustomize.py` that prepends the bundle's
   `Lib\site-packages\` to `sys.path` whenever the embedded
   interpreter starts.
7. Runs a sanity import (`faster_whisper`, `ctranslate2`, `sv_ttk`,
   `platformdirs`, `tkinter`) to confirm the bundle is complete.

Then wrap the tree in an Inno Setup installer:

```cmd
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer_embed.iss
```

Output: `dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Standard.exe`
(~150-400 MB depending on which optional heavy deps — torch/stable-ts
— happen to be present; the batch script prunes them from
`embed_build\`, see its "slim" step).

Method C's shortcuts launch `pythonw.exe gui.py` rather than a
frozen exe, so the entire Python source tree lives on disk after
install — friendlier for debugging or local patching at the cost
of a slightly larger installed footprint.

**This is also how the shipped Portable is built** — it is the exact
same `embed_build\` tree, just zipped whole instead of wrapped by
Inno Setup:

```cmd
python -c "import shutil; shutil.make_archive(r'dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable', 'zip', r'embed_build')"
```

`WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.zip` and
`WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Standard.exe` are the two files that get
uploaded to the GitHub release (see "Rebuild without bumping the
version" below, and `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` for a full version-bump
release).

## Rebuild without bumping the version

Use this when the source changed (a bug fix, a UI tweak, a new writer,
…) but the release is meant to stay the SAME version number — i.e. you
are refreshing an already-published release's assets in place, not
cutting a new one. Confirm this is really what's wanted before
running Step 4 (it overwrites public, already-downloaded release
assets under the same tag).

**Step 1 — confirm the version is genuinely unchanged:**

```cmd
findstr /C:"__version__" core\__init__.py
findstr /C:"MyAppVersion" installer_embed.iss
findstr /C:"^version" pyproject.toml
```

All three must already show the version you intend to ship — this
recipe does NOT bump anything.

**Step 2 — validate the source first** (this is the same bar as any
commit — see CLAUDE.md):

```cmd
python -m pyright app core
python -m pytest tests\ --ignore=tests\smoke
```

Both must be clean before building — the build below has no separate
CI gate to catch a regression.

**Step 3 — full rebuild + package:**

```cmd
build_embed_installer.bat
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer_embed.iss
python -c "import shutil; shutil.make_archive(r'dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable', 'zip', r'embed_build')"
```

`build_embed_installer.bat` always does a **full** rebuild (deletes
and redownloads `embed_build\` from scratch) so the result is not
sensitive to whatever was left over from a previous build — slower
than an incremental refresh, but nothing to get wrong. It ends with
its own sanity imports (full stack, Google Cloud STT, core modules,
`gui.py` parses) and fails loudly (non-zero exit) if anything's
missing.

**Step 4 — update the existing GitHub release's assets in place**
(same tag, no new tag, no version bump):

```cmd
gh release upload vX.Y.Z ^
    dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Setup-Standard.exe ^
    dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.zip ^
    --clobber
```

`--clobber` replaces the existing assets of the same name rather than
erroring that they already exist. This is the step users' next
download actually sees — anyone who already downloaded the old
asset is unaffected (their file doesn't change under them), but
`gh release view vX.Y.Z` afterwards should show fresh
`createdAt`/size for both assets. Optionally follow with `gh release
edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z.md` if the release
notes body should also mention what changed in this refresh.

**Step 4b — macOS, from a Windows machine (can't build a `.dmg` locally):**
there is no local macOS build step here; dispatch the CI workflow and
pull its artifacts instead.

```cmd
gh workflow run macos-app.yml --ref master
:: poll or watch until both matrix legs (arm64, x86_64) finish:
gh run list --workflow=macos-app.yml -L 1
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status

gh run download <run-id> --dir some_temp_dir
:: each matrix leg's artifact folder holds "Whisper Project-<arch>.dmg";
:: copy/rename them to match the release naming convention, then:
gh release upload vX.Y.Z ^
    dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-macOS-arm64.dmg ^
    dist_installer\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-macOS-x86_64.dmg ^
    --clobber
```

`macos-app.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only (see the file's own header
comment) so it never fires by accident on a normal push. The repo is
public, so this no longer burns paid private-repo macOS minutes.

## Sanity check after any build

```cmd
python -m pytest tests\ --ignore=tests\smoke
```

Expected: 162 passed.

For the compiled artefacts, run the smoke E2E against each:

```cmd
:: Method A
set WHISPER_SMOKE_EXE=dist\WhisperProject-vX.Y.Z-Portable.exe
python -m pytest tests\smoke\test_exe_real_e2e.py

:: Method B (after silent install to C:\Temp\test_B)
set WHISPER_SMOKE_EXE=C:\Temp\test_B\WhisperProject.exe
python -m pytest tests\smoke\test_exe_real_e2e.py

:: Method C (after silent install to C:\Temp\test_C)
set WHISPER_SMOKE_EXE=C:\Temp\test_C\python\pythonw.exe
set WHISPER_SMOKE_GUI=C:\Temp\test_C\gui.py
python -m pytest tests\smoke\test_exe_real_e2e.py
```

Each must report `test_exe_worker_transcribes_real_video PASSED`
(plus a skipped size check on Methods B and C — see the test for
why).

## Files involved

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `whisper_project_onefile.spec` | Method A — embedded `EXE()` (no `COLLECT`) |
| `whisper_project_onedir.spec` | Method B — `EXE() + COLLECT()` for the onedir tree |
| `installer.iss` | Method B — wraps `dist_onedir\` into Setup-Compact |
| `build_embed_installer.bat` | Method C — builds `embed_build\` |
| `installer_embed.iss` | Method C — wraps `embed_build\` into Setup-Standard |
| `requirements.txt` | runtime deps installed into Method C's embed tree |
| `bin\` | bundled `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, `yt-dlp.exe` (all methods) |

## Build outputs are gitignored

`dist/`, `dist_onedir/`, `dist_installer/`, `embed_build/`,
`build/`, and `build_logs/` are all in `.gitignore`. Commit only
specs, batch scripts, and `.iss` files.
