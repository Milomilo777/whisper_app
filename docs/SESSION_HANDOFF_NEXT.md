## 1. Current state (2026-05-25)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `master` — **the single mainline** (2026-05-25: `chore/cleanup-hardening` + `basic-edition` were folded into master and deleted; tips kept as `archive/*` tags). Carries **v1.3.6**, all committed + pushed. The whole history was rewritten 2026-05-25 to attribute every commit to `translation-robot` (GitHub no-reply) and strip the old email + all `Co-Authored-By` trailers; local `git config` identity is set to match. |
| Version | pyproject = 1.3.6; `core.__version__` = 1.3.6; both `.iss` = 1.3.6 |
| Last PUBLISHED release | **v1.3.6** on GitHub (Standard + Portable) — Video Tiling tab + Linux/macOS groundwork; built + slim past-bug E2E PASS + hermetic suite green + pyright 0/0/0; published 2026-05-26. |
| GitHub releases now | `v1.3.6` (latest) + `basic-v0.1.0` (separate edition). **POLICY (2026-05-26 owner): keep ONLY the latest release — prune the rest on each release.** Reverses the 2026-05-25 keep-all. Old release objects (v1.3.3–v1.3.5) were deleted; their git tags + the local `dist_installer/` installers remain as backup. |
| Installed test copy | none built (validated by `tools/e2e_slim_pastbugs.py` + `tools/e2e_cancel_pause.py` against the real worker). The user installs the published EXE themselves. |
| Default GitHub branch | `master` (now the ONLY branch — origin has just `master`) |
| Working tree | clean (only `.claude/` untracked) |
| Gate | `run_tests.bat` → pyright 0/0/0 (app/ + core/) + hermetic suite — last run **ALL GREEN** |
| Build prereqs (this PC) | Inno Setup `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe` ✓ · test video `E:\3029-NWN-Daily-Scroll-2m_0002.mp4` ✓ · extracted model under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperProject` ✓ |
| Version source of truth | `core/__init__.py` `__version__` (bundled; About dialog + telemetry read it). Bump it with pyproject + both `.iss` every release. |

### What shipped in v1.3.6 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-26)

Video Tiling tab + Linux/macOS groundwork. Full list: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
+ `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.6.md` + the plan in
`docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_ROADMAP.md`. Headlines: **Video Tiling tab**
(`core/tiling.py` + `build_tiling_tab`) — one live stream filled across the
screen as an N×N grid via `yt-dlp | ffplay -vf tile=NxN` (ports
`translation-robot/video-tiler`); **ffplay is NOT bundled** (would bloat
the build), so the tab detects its absence and tells the user to drop
`ffplay.exe` in `bin/` or put ffmpeg on PATH. **Cross-platform core
hardening** — `yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` resolve per-OS via
`core.paths.bundled_binary` (PATH fallback), `--ffmpeg-location` is only
passed when a bundled ffmpeg exists, VLC discovery covers macOS/Linux; the
Windows build is byte-for-byte the same shape. **`platform/linux/`** (one-
step `install.sh` venv + deps + static-ffmpeg fallback + a headless
`whisper-transcribe` CLI + update/uninstall) and **`platform/macos/`**
(`install.command` + `unblock.command` for Gatekeeper + README). A
`.gitattributes` pins LF on `*.sh`/`*.command`.

**Follow-ups for a future session:**
- Video Tiling needs **ffplay** to actually run. To make it work
  out-of-box on Windows, add `bin/ffplay.exe` (from the full ffmpeg build)
  — either commit it (repo already LFS-warns on the ~97 MB ffmpeg.exe) or,
  cleaner, have `build_embed_installer.bat` fetch ffplay into
  `embed_build/bin` at build time. Deferred to keep the build/repo size
  unchanged this release.
- **macOS is unvalidated** — no Mac was available. The code + scripts
  follow best practice but need a real-device run (see `platform/macos/README.md`).
- Linux scripts are `bash -n`-clean but not run on a real distro here; the
  maintainer confirmed transcription works on their Linux server.

### What shipped in v1.3.5 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-25)

Real Pause/Resume/Cancel + a post-slim hardening pass (five parallel
code-audit shards over everything that changed in v1.3.x). Full list:
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.5.md`. Headlines:
**cooperative pause/resume/cancel (#37)** — the worker now reads control
commands on a dedicated `worker-stdin` reader thread and flips the
in-flight task's `cancelled`/`paused` flags while the main thread is busy
in `transcribe()`; the transcriber already polled those between segments
(and flushes a resumable checkpoint on cancel), so only signal delivery
was missing. `app/app.py` pause/resume/cancel now call
`TranscriptionService.send_control(task, action)` instead of killing the
worker; a per-worker `stdin_lock` serialises the three concurrent writers.
**The worker reports the files it actually wrote** in the `done` event
(`task.output_paths` → `finish_task` history + `show_last_result`), so a
docx/pdf-only run no longer shows "no output files found". Plus the audit
fixes: a "transcribing" download row is cancellable; `_fmt_timecode`
sub-second carry (`1:30.999` → `0:01:31`); per-format writer resilience
(one bad writer no longer discards the good ones); pausing a not-yet-
running task is a no-op; `progress_cell`/`marquee_cell` tolerate a
non-finite percent; on-demand installs are serialised + log on the UI
thread; the slim build drops the orphaned `llvmlite.libs` and its sanity
check imports docx/reportlab to guard the docx-regression class. New
tests: `test_worker_control`, `test_cancel_checkpoint` (deterministic
faked-model cancel→checkpoint), done-event outputs, sub-second timecode;
new live driver `tools/e2e_cancel_pause.py`.

### What shipped in v1.3.4 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-25)

Slim install + on-demand optional deps + the docx fix. Full list:
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.4.md`. Headlines:
**slim ~800 MB install** (was ~1.5 GB) — `build_embed_installer.bat`
now prunes the heavy optional libraries (torch, torchaudio,
openai-whisper, stable-ts, numba, llvmlite, sympy, networkx, mpmath)
after pip install; the Standard installer dropped 348 MB → 219 MB and
the Portable ZIP 557 MB → 326 MB. **On-demand optional features**
(`core/optional_deps.py`) — Word-timestamp alignment (stable-ts) and the
openai-whisper backend now `pip install --target` into a user pylibs dir
(~700 MB, one time) the first time they're used; `app/app.py`
`_offer_optional_install` asks first (askyesno + a threaded Toplevel
progress), then restarts the worker. The core stack (faster-whisper) is
still bundled so transcription/subtitles/diarisation/downloads/the
time-range slider all work out of the box. **DOCX (+ PDF) output fix** —
the worker's config snapshot was stale, so `output_formats` never crossed
the process boundary and docx was silently dropped; `output_formats` is
now threaded transcribe_command → worker → `_write_outputs`.
New: `tools/e2e_slim_pastbugs.py` (slim-build past-bug release gate) +
`tests/core/test_optional_deps.py`.

### What shipped in v1.3.3 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-25; pruned then RESTORED — still on GitHub)

Position slider on the Download tab (#39) + clip/range review fixes, and
the first Portable ZIP of the embed tree. Full list: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
+ `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.3.md`. Headlines: a **draggable Start/End
position slider** on the Download tab (`set_download_duration` /
`_on_download_scale`, guarded by `_suppress_scale_cb` + a
`_download_duration<=0` disable) wired to the time-range fields; review
fixes from three code-review shards — the slider `set()` no longer
clobbers typed values, a clipped run forces `resume=False` (no checkpoint
keyed to the whole file), and `start>=end` is dropped to open-ended.

### What shipped in v1.3.2 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-25, now pruned from GitHub)

Security + features, after a second bug-hunt (4 more parallel shards:
concurrency, resource-leaks, hostile-input, security). Full list:
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.2.md`. Headlines:
**SECURITY** — yt-dlp option injection closed (a "-"-prefixed pasted URL
could hit `--exec`; `"--"` end-of-options added in all 3 yt-dlp argv
builders, regression-tested) + zip-slip guard on model-archive extract;
**Transcribe-tab time range** (#28) — clip_timestamps through the worker,
end-to-end verified (transcribed only 120–180s of a 10-min file, original
timeline, progress→100%); **multi-site download error visibility** — the
queue now shows yt-dlp's real ERROR line + a "Cookies from browser" hint
for login-walled sites (Facebook); **ffprobe "N/A"** tolerated;
**progress %% kept visible** during the startup marquee; a contributed
**hub_folder/model_path** fix (collaborator commit 5b59fbc).

### Still pending (next session)
- **#37 worker cancel/pause/checkpoint — DONE in v1.3.5.** A cooperative
  control channel now delivers cancel/pause/resume to the running worker
  (a `worker-stdin` reader thread flips the in-flight task's flags); pause
  truly halts, resume continues, and cancel flushes a resumable checkpoint
  instead of killing the worker. Proven by `tests/core/test_worker_control.py`
  + `tests/core/test_cancel_checkpoint.py` + `tools/e2e_cancel_pause.py`.
  Residual (NOT addressed): `ensure_worker_ready(headless=True)` could
  still deadlock if ever called on the Tk main thread — low risk (the
  headless path is only invoked off the main thread today).
- **Resource leaks (MED).** Killing a worker orphans its grandchild
  ffmpeg/demucs (no process-group/job-object kill); `partials/` grows
  unbounded (a killed worker leaves the checkpoint JSON + `.slice.wav`; no
  startup sweep; declining crash-resume doesn't delete the JSON);
  HistoryDB connection isn't closed in on_exit; demucs cache unbounded.
- **#38 selector tuning** — the download selector already falls back to a
  combined stream (`/best`) so it isn't YouTube-locked; the real fix
  shipped is the ERROR SURFACING. Once a user retries Dailymotion on
  v1.3.2 and the queue shows the actual error, fix that specific cause
  (don't change the selector blind — risks the proven YouTube path).
- **burn_subs filter escaping (MED, deferred)** — the SRT path injected
  into ffmpeg's `subtitles=` filter escapes only `\` and `:`, not `'[],`;
  a crafted on-disk filename could break out. Needs a burn-subs test
  harness before changing (don't break normal paths).

### What shipped in v1.3.1 (PUBLISHED 2026-05-25, now pruned from GitHub)

Reliability bug-hunt on top of v1.3.0 (traced each UI action through the
code + four parallel audit agents). Full list: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` +
`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.1.md`. Headlines: **non-ASCII filename downloads
now transcribe** — yt-dlp stdout forced to UTF-8 (`_utf8_subprocess_env`)
PLUS a self-healing fallback (`DownloadService._recover_saved_path`) that
finds the real downloaded file if the parsed path is wrong; **language
codes normalized on the DEFAULT path** (`_normalize_language` now in
`_build_transcribe_kwargs`, not just the alt-backend call — fixes "en-US"
and multi-value picker codes like "zh-Hans,zh-CN" crashing the worker);
**VLC found via registry/Program Files** with a clear 64-bit hint
(`_locate_vlc_dir`); **download cancel stops the linked transcription** +
**re-run keeps the time-range**; **optional-dep probes catch OSError**
(diarization/parakeet/whisper_cpp no longer crash the app on a bad native
DLL — VLC bug class); Transcribe **path validation**; demucs via
`sys.executable`. Plus the queue **"working" marquee** animation and the
**0:00:00 time-range defaults**. New tests: test_normalize_language,
test_recover_saved_path, test_transcribe_kwargs, test_progress_cell
(+marquee).

### Still pending (next session)
- **#28 — time-range for the Transcribe tab**: let the user transcribe
  only a slice of a long local file. Recommended approach: faster-whisper
  `clip_timestamps` threaded through `_build_transcribe_kwargs` (the
  central kwargs builder), with the per-segment progress % computed
  relative to the clip bounds (transcriber.py:~1123) so the bar still
  fills 0→100. Add Start/End fields to the Transcribe tab + clip_start/end
  on TranscriptionTask.
- **Minor**: `watched_folder` has no `_drive_is_mounted` deferral like
  download_folder/model_path, so a not-yet-mounted/temp watched folder is
  silently dropped at launch (app/app.py watched-folder branch). Low
  urgency (degrades gracefully, just doesn't watch).

### What shipped in v1.3.0 (published 2026-05-25, now pruned from GitHub)

UX + reliability on top of v1.2.0. Full list: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` +
`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.0.md`. Headlines: **fixed auto-transcribe after
a merged video+audio download** (the saved-path parser matched the
yt-dlp-deleted audio fragment, so Shorts / reels silently failed to
transcribe — now `select_saved_path` makes the merged file win); per-row
**graphical progress bars** in both queues (`progress_cell`); the
**version is now visible** (window title `_base_title` + a version-stamped
installer shortcut via a `#define MyAppVersion` knob); the **Download row
shows "transcribing" + live progress** after an auto-transcribe (linked
via `TranscriptionTask.source_download` ↔
`VideoDownloadTask.transcription_task`, flipped back in `finish_task`);
the **"Last result" card** no longer expands to fill the Transcribe tab;
and the **language picker resets to "Auto" every launch** (no longer
persisted; other prefs still are).

### What shipped in v1.2.0 (published 2026-05-25, now pruned from GitHub)

UX + accessibility on top of v1.1.0. Full list: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` +
`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.0.md`. Headlines: app-wide copy/paste fix
(layout-independent Ctrl+C/V/X/A + right-click menus on every text field
+ a copyable log console), bulk multi-select queue actions (cancel /
re-run / resume / remove), auto-hiding queue scrollbars, model
download-status + a "Download now" button, "Open file" for finished
downloads, output-file de-dup (`name (1).srt`), the About dialog showing
the live version, and a stable installer `AppId` (single Add/Remove
entry that upgrades cleanly).

### v1.1.0 changes (folded into the published v1.2.0; v1.1.0 itself pruned)

Audio-in-downloads fix, the main-thread model-load freezes (download /
crash-resume / watched-folder), model-hub + download-folder persistence,
crash-resume nag, truncated-SMTV-download, About repo-URL removal, and
the opt-in "Cookies from browser" feature. Bug-hunt method + findings:
`docs/AUDIT_2026-05-25_boundary_bugs.md`.

## 2. Shipped deliverables — Standard + Portable (both embed-based)

Two published assets per release, both built from the slim
`embed_build\` tree (embeddable CPython 3.11 + deps):

| Asset | Local path | Size (v1.3.4) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup-Standard | `dist_installer/WhisperProject-v1.3.4-Setup-Standard.exe` | 219 MB | installs to Program Files (admin), shell-extension + shortcuts |
| Portable | `dist_installer/WhisperProject-v1.3.4-Portable.zip` | 326 MB | `shutil.make_archive` of `embed_build\`; extract + run `Run Whisper Project.bat`, no install |

History: v1.0.3 shipped a PyInstaller Portable EXE; 2026-05-24 the policy
was "Standard only"; **the user then asked for Portable back as a ZIP of
the embed tree (v1.3.2+).** Both ship now. The PyInstaller Compact
(`whisper_project_onedir.spec` + `installer.iss`) and onefile Portable
(`whisper_project_onefile.spec`) pipelines remain maintained-but-unshipped
(keep their hidden-import lists current so they don't bit-rot).

Download from:
**[github.com/Milomilo777/whisper_project_direct_download_v2/releases/latest](https://github.com/Milomilo777/whisper_project_direct_download_v2/releases/latest)**

## 3. RELEASES — v1.3.6 latest, DONE (2026-05-26).

**v1.3.6** is live (Video Tiling tab + Linux/macOS groundwork; Standard
219 MB + Portable 326 MB). The step log below is from v1.3.4 and documents
the identical pipeline (bump → build → compile → zip → e2e → publish).

**Release policy (2026-05-26 owner — reverses the 2026-05-25 keep-all):**
- **Keep ONLY the latest release.** After publishing vNEW, DELETE the older
  release objects (`gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes` — keeps the git tag +
  the local `dist_installer/` installer as backup). Only the latest + the
  separate `basic-v0.1.0` stay on the Releases page. (So step 7 below now
  means "prune the previous release," the opposite of before.)
- **Release LESS often** — batch several features/fixes per version
  (owner: "half or a third the speed"); don't cut a version per small change.
- **Push in batches** — commit locally often, push several commits together.

---

v1.3.4 was live on GitHub (Standard + Portable). Steps that ran:

1. ✅ Gate green: pyright `app/ core/` 0/0/0; hermetic suite (tests/ minus
   tests/smoke) exit 0.
2. ✅ Slim embed rebuild (`build_embed_installer.bat`, now prunes the
   heavy libs) — `embed_build\` = **805 MB** (was 1.6 GB), "embed_import_ok"
   + "build complete". Verified: torch/stable_whisper/whisper absent,
   faster_whisper present, `optional_deps.is_available("alignment"/"whisper_backend")`
   both False (on-demand path live).
3. ✅ Standard installer compiled clean (290 s) →
   `dist_installer\WhisperProject-v1.3.4-Setup-Standard.exe` (**219 MB**,
   size-stable + MZ magic). IMPORTANT: ISCC writes the EXE incrementally —
   wait for the "Successful compile" line / a stable size before publishing
   (a mid-write EXE looks smaller and ships corrupt). Here the background
   task exited 0 AND printed "Successful compile", so the size was final.
4. ✅ Portable ZIP via `embed_build\python\python.exe -c "shutil.make_archive(...)"`
   → `dist_installer\WhisperProject-v1.3.4-Portable.zip` (**326 MB**,
   testzip OK, has `Run Whisper Project.bat` + `gui.py`, no torch).
5. ✅ Past-bug E2E on the slim embed tree (`tools/e2e_slim_pastbugs.py`,
   run with the embed python) — drives the REAL worker over JSON stdin/
   stdout and asserts every output format lands. PASS: docx (36954 B, valid
   PK magic) + srt + json + txt all written; `en-US` normalised to `en` (no
   crash); clip 0–20s produced output (progress→100); apostrophe+space
   filename round-tripped.
6. ✅ Published — `gh release create v1.3.4 <Standard.exe> <Portable.zip>
   --target chore/cleanup-hardening --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.4.md`;
   both assets `state=uploaded`, sizes match local.
7. ✅ Pruned v1.3.3 (`gh release delete v1.3.3 --cleanup-tag --yes`) —
   GitHub now has only `v1.3.4` + `basic-v0.1.0` (archive tags kept).
   **POLICY CHANGE (2026-05-25): this was the LAST prune.** Right after
   v1.3.4 shipped the user said "از این به بعد نسخه‌های قدیمی را پاک نکن" —
   do NOT delete old releases going forward. Future releases publish the
   new version and **leave every prior release + tag in place**. (The
   pruned v1.3.3 local artefacts still sit under `dist_installer/` if the
   user ever wants v1.3.3 re-published.)
8. **GUI-manual checks for the user** (not automatable): pick docx in
   Advanced settings → confirm a .docx lands next to the media; select
   Word-timestamp alignment → confirm the on-demand download prompt appears
   (and works) on a machine without torch; the Download-tab position slider;
   a non-YouTube / login-walled download (the queue shows the real error +
   cookie hint).

**To cut the NEXT release** (vX.Y.Z), bump the version in
`core/__init__.py` + `pyproject.toml` + both `.iss` files (the embed
`.iss` reads `#define MyAppVersion`), then repeat steps 1–7 — and step 7
now means **prune the previous release** (`gh release delete` the old one,
keep only the latest + `basic-v0.1.0`). Use absolute
paths via `cmd.exe` (a background cmd may not inherit cwd); `<REPO>` =
`C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\whisper_project_claude\whisper_project_direct_download_v2`.
Full step-by-step lives in `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.

### Deferred bug-audit items (`docs/AUDIT_2026-05-25_boundary_bugs.md`)
- SMTV cancel-latency on a stalled socket + no-retry; a site-layout
  change silently empties the article transcript.
- Worker-lifecycle: `_pending_load_*` dangle if the awaited worker dies;
  `startup_error` tears down ALL workers, not just the failing one.
- Download rows stuck `interrupted` skew `stats()`.
- Hardware-probe stall (async attempt was REVERTED — a real fix needs
  `test_hardware_wizard_constructs_without_crashing` made async-aware).
- **Class C — needs a REAL yt-dlp + ffprobe harness before changing:**
  `--download-sections` keyframe snap (clip starts early), sub-second
  timecode, open-left `*-MM:SS` bound. Do NOT "fix" these blind.
- Older: P1s in `docs/STABILITY_AUDIT_2026-05-23.md`; SMTV server-side
  time-range slicing (limitation in `docs/integrations/smtv-brief.md`).

## 4. Branch + tag map

```
origin/master                       ← THE single branch; HEAD; carries v1.3.5
  tag v1.3.5                        ← the current release commit
  tag v1.3.4, v1.3.3                ← kept (releases are never pruned)
  tag v1.0.3                        ← earlier release commit (7295872)
  tag archive/cleanup-hardening-final ← old chore/cleanup-hardening tip (= master now)
  tag archive/basic-edition         ← old basic-edition tip (998 tests + downloads)
  tag archive/master-pre-merge      ← old (pre-2026-05-25) master Session-9 lineage
  tag archive/release-v0.7-baseline ← pre-orphan snapshot (recovery aid)
  tag v0.7.1, v0.7.0                ← historical releases
```

master's current history is the former `chore/cleanup-hardening` orphan
lineage (a squashed base + the v1.0.3 → v1.3.5 commits) — that's the
preserved project progress. The superseded pre-merge master (Session-9
era) and the deleted branches all live on as the `archive/*` tags above,
so nothing was lost.

## 5. The 1-line restart prompt

```
Read docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_NEXT.md first, then continue on master (the single mainline). Normal pushes to master are fine; don't force-push / rewrite master and don't move or delete published release tags (v1.0.3+ are public) without an explicit ask.
```

## 6. Forbidden actions (durable; mirrors CLAUDE.md)

- Don't `git push --force` / rewrite history on `master` (without an
  explicit ask) — normal pushes are fine now that master is the mainline
- Don't move or delete a **published release tag** (`v1.0.3`+ are public;
  moving them invalidates downloaded artefacts)
- Prune old GitHub releases — keep ONLY the latest + `basic-v0.1.0`
  (2026-05-26 owner; reverses the 2026-05-25 keep-all). Release less often;
  push commits in batches.
- Don't touch `.git/config`
- Don't code-sign the EXE

## 7. Sanity-check commands for the next session

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\whisper_project_claude\whisper_project_direct_download_v2
git log --oneline -5
git status
pyright app/ core/
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/smoke
```

Expected: the full hermetic suite passes (exit 0), pyright 0/0/0,
working tree clean. Optionally re-run the slim-build release gate
`embed_build\python\python.exe tools\e2e_slim_pastbugs.py` (PASS) after a
rebuild.
